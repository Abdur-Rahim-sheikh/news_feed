### An app to show personalized news for each user

#### Instructions to run

For project simplicity, I have dockerized the whole project.
So to run the project you need docker.

1. clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Abdur-Rahim-sheikh/news_feed.git
```

2. Open terminal here

```bash
cd news_feed
```

3. create dot env file in both `frontend` and `backend` provide due credentials.
4. Run any of the below command from root directory
   ```bash
       docker compose up
   ```
   or
   ```
        make run
   ```
